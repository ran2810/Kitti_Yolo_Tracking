1. Object Class (type)
Possible values: Car, Van, Truck, Pedestrian, Person_sitting, Cyclist, Tram, Misc, DontCare

2. Truncation (truncated)
Float between 0 and 1
0.0 → fully visible
1.0 → completely truncated (rare)

3. Occlusion (occluded)
Integer:
Value	Meaning
0		fully visible
1		partly occluded
2		largely occluded
3		unknown

4. Alpha (Observation Angle)
Angle of object relative to camera
Range: [-π, π]

5–8. 2D Bounding Box (bbox)
in Pixel coordinates: bbox_left   bbox_top   bbox_right   bbox_bottom

9–11. 3D Dimensions in meters (height, width, length)

12–14. 3D Location (x, y, z)
Object center in camera coordinates (meters)

15. Rotation_y
